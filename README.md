# Nexit

Nexit is based on my previous BLUD project, BLUD was designed as an API for managing users within a database....

BLUD used a NOSQL database so I decided to make a new project using a SQL database

This project includes:

-express
- dotenv
- path
- mysql
- mariadb
- nodejs

# Contribute:

# Commands:

```
npm start # build the project (prestart script) and start the server

npm run start:dev # start the project in watch mode (nodemon)

npm run serve # start the project without building the project (ts-node)

npm run build # builds the project to ./dist

npm run debug # turns on the debug mode and runs npm run start

npm run dev # turns on the debug mode and runs npm run start:dev
```
